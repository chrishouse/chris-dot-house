I was the sole designer and developer on this project. The site is built entirely with WordPress using the [_s (Underscores)][underscores] blank starter theme. I utilized Sass heavily on this project. I built the responsive and touch-friendly carousel with [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/).

This is my company's website. I was the sole designer and developer on this project. The site is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery, with WordPress being used for the blog. This was my most interesting and challenging project, as it needed to not only be a demonstration of my skills, but also a key piece of marketing for my company.

(As web developer at [AMP][amp])

Like all of my work with AMP, this was a team project in which I was responsible for the design of the site, as well as the development of the public-facing front end. Built with Microsoft SharePoint, the TLA site is noteworthy for its use of an iframe-based sign-in system and a jQuery-driven side panel navigation menu.

I was the sole developer on this project, with my wife Samantha lending a hand with some of the design (the logo, in particular). Built entirely with WordPress using the [_s (Underscores)][underscores] blank starter theme, the goal of this project was to create a professional and informational site with a soothing, uncluttered design.

#### [American College of Healthcare Architects](http://www.healtharchitects.org)

(As web developer at [AMP][amp])

This was a team project at AMP in which I was responsible for the design and the development of the public-facing front end. Built with Microsoft SharePoint, this was the first site with AMP in which I incorporated inline SVG icons into the main navigation.


#### [SE House Designs](http://www.sehousedesigns.com)

<a href="http://www.sehousedesigns.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-se-house-designs-large.jpg" srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-se-house-designs-large.jpg 940w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-se-house-designs-medium.jpg 700w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-se-house-designs-small.jpg 400w" alt="SE House Designs"></a>

Built with custom JavaScript/jQuery, this is a personal project for my wife Samantha's art portfolio. The main goal was to create a smooth, streamlined experience. Although I likely would have been better off utilize a framework like React, this was a great learning experience, and we're both happy with the result.

#### [Starfield Ministries](http://www.starfieldministries.org)

<a href="http://www.starfieldministries.org"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-starfield-ministries-large.jpg" srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-starfield-ministries-large.jpg 940w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-starfield-ministries-medium.jpg 700w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-starfield-ministries-small.jpg 400w" alt="Starfield Ministries"></a>

(As owner and front-end developer at [Caiman Web Design][cwd])

I was the sole designer and developer on this site. Built with WordPress and the [_s][underscores] starter theme, the Starfield Ministries site marked a couple of firsts for me: it was the first time I dabbled in custom parallax effects, and it was the first time I used the "hamburger" style hidden menu exclusively. 

#### [Holden FUMC](http://www.holdenfumc.org)

<a href="http://www.holdenfumc.org"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-holden-large.jpg" srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-holden-large.jpg 940w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-holden-medium.jpg 700w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-holden-small.jpg 400w" alt="Holden FUMC"></a>

This is another site built with WordPress and the [_s][underscores] starter theme. I designed and developed it for the Holden First United Methodist Church as a means to convey its family-oriented and welcoming personality. The technical highlight of the site is the JavaScript-driven semi-transparent triangle design partially overlaying the home page image collage.

<!-- #### [Samantha.House](http://samantha.house)

<a href="http://samantha.house"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-samantha-dot-house-large.jpg" srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-samantha-dot-house-large.jpg 940w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-samantha-dot-house-medium.jpg 700w, {{ site.baseurl }}/images/work-samantha-dot-house-small.jpg 400w" alt="Samantha.House"></a>

This is a portfolio site for Samantha's graphic design work. I developed the site and we both contributed to the design. It's built with [Jekyll][jekyll], which turned out to be a wonderful fit for this type of portfolio website. Updating content is quick and simple, and the site is lightning fast, despite being image-heavy. -->

I designed and developed this site for the fictional company using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery. It was my first time utilizing a fullscreen hero image, as well as my first time incorporating a sticky header menu.
